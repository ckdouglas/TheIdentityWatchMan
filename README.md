 # Identity Server playground that lets you have :-

## _Authentication as a Service_
   > Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services). IdentityServer is an officially certified implementation of OpenID Connect.

## _Single Sign-on / Sign-out_
> Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

## _Access Control for APIs_
> Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and native/mobile apps.

## _Federation Gateway_
> Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc. This shields your applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

## _Focus on Customization_
> The most important part - many aspects of IdentityServer can be customized to fit your needs. Since IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product or a SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.
